\begin{abstract}
	
	Macromolecules such as proteins are the building blocks of the machinery of life, and therefore are essential to the comprehension of physiological processes.	
	As knowledge in this area grows with the advances of modern science, efficient communication of this information is becoming a necessity.	
	Visual communication such as illustrations and animations are often utilized because they can easily be understood with almost no background knowledge of biology.
	However, their realization requires numerous month of manual work which is both expensive and time consuming.	
	Computational biology experts produce everyday large amount of data that is publicly available and that contains valuable information about the structure, and also the function of these macromolecules.	
	Instead on relying on manual work to generate illustrative visualizations of the machinery of life, we envision a solution that would utilize all the data already available and that would streamline the production as much as possible.

	In this thesis are presented several contributions that aim at enabling our vision, and address the challenges that we have encountered along the way.
	First a novel rendering pipeline that allows interactive rendering of large molecular datasets comprising hundreds of millions of macromolecules.
	Furthermore, a new scene composition approach to improve spatial exploration of dense whole-cell structures modelled at atomic resolution.
	Third, a solution to visualize timelapse of dynamic and large scale molecular agent simulation that also reveal invisible information that is only observable at higher temporal resolutions.
	And finally, a new type of agent-based system that is capable of providing a similar visual output as regular but expensive agent-based simulation methods, which allows us to visualize and interact with the simulation of a biological system in real-time.
	These new visualization technologies are showcased with accurate scientific data which was collected with the help of experts, and were also designed and validated in collaboration with renowned scientific illustrators.
